                working creatively, I've come to notice that our projects usually ends
                up becoming something like a small-scaled epic journey, worthy to be
                told, written down or even sung about. It can be one of people, of
                emotions, of ups and downs, of lessons learned and hopefully of time
                well spent. It's my creed that every journey we make ends up being
                enjoyable, at least to some degree. Be it the reason why we do it in
                the first place, who we do it with, or because of the memories we end
                up making.`,

                enjoys a whole bunch of stuff. Be it going out exploring on my bike,
                playing games, spending countless hours organizing something that
                desperately needs it, cooking for friends, or applying myself when
                picking up a new skill, I like to spend the time doing things that
                makes me happy and content. I haven't always been the best at that
                last part, but I'm getting better.`,
