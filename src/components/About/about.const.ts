From starting out with studying <strong>Graphic Design</strong> to freelance in <strong>Frontend development</strong>, to do <strong>Management</strong> and all manner of hijinxes while volunteering, to working in kitchens as <strong>Chef</strong> and as a <strong>Barista</strong>, only to return to the world of <strong>UX Design</strong> and <strong>Development</strong> again. It's been a wild ride, but I wouldn't have it any other way.`,
      `As a visual designer I've spent many hours in <strong>Photoshop</strong>, <strong>Illustrator</strong> and <strong>InDesign</strong>, but nowadays I do most of that work in <strong>Figma</strong> as the ease of access and prototyping capabilities serves me well.`,
      `Back when I started doing frontend development, I was mostly working with <strong>HTML</strong> and building the pages using table-elements, only to grasp CSS a bit later and eventually start running Wordpress and dabbing a bit into <strong>PHP</strong>. Nowadays I'm more comfortable with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>, adding on <strong>Tailwind</strong> which I didn't like at all at first, but I find it gells well with my workflow now.`,
      `There's some forays into <strong>Backend development</strong> as well, mainly through <strong>REST</strong>, but I'm not as comfortable there. Who knows, perhaps that will be the next big challenge.`,

                enjoys a whole bunch of stuff (I swear!). Be it going out exploring on my bike,
                playing games (both digitally and physically), spending countless hours organizing something that
                desperately needs it, cooking for friends, or applying myself when
                picking up a new skill, I like to spend the time doing things that
                makes me happy and content. I haven't always been the best at that
